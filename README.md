# PythonFinance

Some of my python projects for market finance

**Projects**:
1. S&P500 Study : OLS & Lasso Regression, SMA, trying to find a model to predict S&P500 with multiple variables
2. Jegadeesh-Titman portfolio strategy : Winner & Looser - applied on CAC40
3. Long/short momentum/value Strategy on european stocks ("DATA.xlsx": required file for this project with returns, benchmark returns and price to book)
4. Montecarlo simulation using Object Oriented Programming. This was my first project using class concept, I will further improve my skills in OOP in order to be able to deliver bigger, consistent projects.
5. Logistic Regression: to predict the rise/fall of the Google share (binary value) considering the rises/falls of a series of shares over the same day (continuous values) (using sklearn: AUC, ROC analysis, RFE)
